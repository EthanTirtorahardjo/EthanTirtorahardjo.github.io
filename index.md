### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, Part 1, was one of my personal favorites because it allowed us to practice the usage of doubles and converting values, or in this case, measurements. Lab 4 also had us creating sentence outputs with "cout", intertwining both variables and words. Part 1 specifically had us converting a lot of variables so we also got practice using math equations and symbols with said doubles. All together Lab 4 allowed us to get comfortable with these simple ideaas and programs. 

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, Part 1, was a very helpful lab because it gave us a look at arguments and placement. It gave us experience with argument size which became extremely helpful in future labs and also taught us how to name arugument locations with strings. Lab 6 also taught us how to output error messages and std::cerr.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 2, one of the harder labs and one of the ones I struggled most with. Part 2, had a lot of variables and IF statements, making it quite confusing. If I recall correctly it was also the first time we used so many BOOL which added a level of complexity that I was unfamiliar with at the time. It also had us inputting a lot of conditions to our statements which made it difficult to make sure everything was correctly placed.
